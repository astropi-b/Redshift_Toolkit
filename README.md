# Redshift_Toolkit
This application enables users to calculate astronomical redshifts, observed and emitted wavelengths (or frequencies), and cosmic distances using a user-friendly graphical interface. It provides an interactive and educational tool for understanding and performing essential calculations in astrophysics.




## Key Features

- **Calculation of redshift** based on observed and emitted wavelengths or frequencies.
- **Determination of observed wavelength/frequency** given the redshift and emitted wavelength/frequency, and vice versa.
- **Estimation of cosmic distances** using the calculated redshift, leveraging the Hubble's Law with a predefined Hubble constant and the speed of light.
- **Dynamic user interface** that updates input fields based on the selected operation (calculating redshift, observed properties, or emitted properties) and the  chosen unit of measurement (wavelength or frequency).
- **Error handling** for invalid input values.
- **Display of formulas and constants** used in the calculations, enhancing the educational value of the application.
